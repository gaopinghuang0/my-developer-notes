* [Skip List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list).
* [Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)](https://medium.com/@adityakumar_98609/fenwick-tree-binary-index-tree-aca7824d9c2a). Compared to Segment Tree, BIT requires less space and is easier to implement.
* [Segment Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-sum-of-given-range/).  It is more flexible than BIT. It is able to retrieve the sum, max, min, gcd, or other stuff of the elements between `(l, r)`.
