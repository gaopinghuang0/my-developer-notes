## Unity

### Basic Tutorials
* [FPS Microgame](https://learn.unity.com/project/fps-template)

### Best Practices
* [Unity3D Best Practices (2013)](http://www.glenstevens.ca/unity3d-best-practices/). Some of them are outdated, but things related to prefabs are inspiring:
  * Use prefabs for everything, even unique game objects should be prefabs.
  * Use separate prefabs for specialization; do not specialize instances. 
    * Watch this video: [Improved Prefab Workflows: Nested Prefabs, Prefab Mode and Prefab Variants (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&v=ibmdm_PoyMA&feature=emb_logo).
  * Link prefabs to prefabs; do not link instances to instances.
