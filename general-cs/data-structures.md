* [Skip List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list).
* [Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)](https://medium.com/@adityakumar_98609/fenwick-tree-binary-index-tree-aca7824d9c2a). This blog also includes BIT for 2D array. Compared to Segment Tree, BIT requires less space and is easier to implement.  BIT(idx) uses 1-based index (`idx`). Then `idx & (-idx)` will get the least significant set bit (LSB). For example, 6 in binary is 110, whose LSB is at the second to the rightmost bit. Similarly, 5 in binary is 101 whose LSB is the rightmost bit. When getting the range sum of idx, keep adding `BIT(idx)` and removing the LSB from idx until idx is 0. When updating the value at idx, keep adding the LSB until greater than size of array.
* [Segment Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segment-tree-set-1-sum-of-given-range/).  It is more flexible than BIT. It is able to retrieve the sum, max, min, gcd, or other stuff of the elements between `(l, r)`.
* Trie and Radix Tree (or Radix Trie) and Suffix Tree.
